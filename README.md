# Chatty - Angular

This is a simple chatting service which is created as a slack like clone that uses Angular and Firebase Realtime Database to implement the frontend and backend respectively

## Motivation

Chatty or a chatting service is general is what I use when I want to learn a new front end framework but I want to solve a problem that I already know most of the answers to. Its very interesting to get started with a new framework and see the kind of advantages and disadvantages that they have in comparison to the other frameworks.

This version was actually the first version that I ever implemented, and as such is a bit... rougher around the edges. I have learned a lot in the time between making this project and now, and I find it exciting to see how I have improved and how much simpler it is to make this project in my more recent frameworks (like React and Vue).

## Local Installation

After cloning the repository locally you can get started by just installing the dependencies and then the server

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You should be able to navigate to `http:localhost:3000` and see the site.

## Future Work

I do not intend to significantly change or add to this project, and as such there is no future work planned and I am not merging pull requests in
